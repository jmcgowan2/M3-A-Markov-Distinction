Golf Course Generator: America & Europe by James McGowan (Septmeber 17, 2024)

Description --- This computationally creative system constructs golf courses by combining tee boxes, landscapes, and greens from the most prestigious American and European golf courses. It demonstrates the various ways golf courses can be laid out, offering a visual representation of each unique layout. Assuming PIL/matplotlib is installed, simply run the program using Python and it will generate a course (no input is needed).

Personnally Meainingful --- This system is particularly meaningful to me because it was the first computationally creative idea I developed and submitted for M1. My connection to golf began when I was injured and couldn't play basketball, which led me to start watching the sport. Over time, my interest grew, and I began playing golf and have been tracking my progress using the handicap system. This project blends my passion for both golf and technology, using courses that I’ve watched on TV and would love to play someday.

Challenging --- This project challenged me as a computer scientist, especially in the beginning. I never thought that designing golf courses was something I could do computationally, and taking the first step was particularly difficult because I wasn’t sure where to start. Initially, I tried using various courses all at once, but this approach led to designs that, while interesting, weren’t practical. American and European courses have distinct characteristics, and blending them didn’t work. This forced me to change direction and separate the courses based on region, helping me realize the importance of strategy and adjustment in tackling complex problems. The next step that would be important to focus on is aligning the images properly so that combinations can be accurately evaluated. Then, it would be cool to scale and use hundreds of golf courses.

Creative --- I believe this system is creative because every course is unique and original. It follow our definition from the first class: "utilizing programming languages to bring orginal, creative ideas to life" --- the system bring my ideas about designing golf courses to life.
